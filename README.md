# Observations on Time Series Forecasting (Energy Consumption Forecasting) using LSTMs

## Problem Description:

 - LSTMs are widely used for time series forecasting due to their capability to capture complex temporal dependencies and effectively handle long-term memory.
  
-  Time series datasets often display recurring patterns, such as annual cycles or weekly trends. LSTMs excel at modeling both long-term and short-term seasonal variations in the data, capturing non-linear relationships through the use of several 
   gates.
  
  - The dataset contains features such as date and time, power consumption (in kilowatts), voltage, current, and power usage in different parts of the house.

## Objective:

- Implement an LSTM-based deep learning model to forecast daily energy consumption for an individual household.
- Such forecasts can help optimize energy usage, reduce electric bills, and promote energy savings.

## Steps Involved:

### Data Pre-processing:

- Handle missing values, if any, and perform any required transformations to prepare the data for time series modeling.
- Resample the data to an appropriate interval (e.g., daily) to generate the target variable for forecasting.
- Scale features using a suitable scaler, such as MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler, to improve model training.

### LSTM Model Development:

  - Develop an LSTM model using TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.
  - Define an appropriate architecture, including the number of LSTM units, activation functions, and regularization techniques.
  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure effective evaluation of the model.

### Model Training:

  - Train the LSTM model with suitable hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
  - Use early stopping and checkpointing techniques to prevent overfitting and save the best model.

### Evaluation:

  - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
  - Compare the forecasted daily energy consumption with actual values to assess the accuracy of the model.

### Visualization:

- Plot the forecasted vs. actual energy usage to visualize the model's performance.
- Provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model based on the plots.

### Summary:

  - This LSTM-based model for energy consumption forecasting aims to help optimize household energy usage, reduce costs, and support energy conservation efforts.
  - By implementing robust pre-processing, model development, evaluation, and visualization, you can gain insights into temporal energy consumption patterns and make more informed decisions about energy management.
